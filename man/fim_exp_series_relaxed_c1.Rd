\title{FIM for exponential series system with relaxed C1}
\usage{
fim_exp_series_relaxed_c1(t, C, delta = NULL, P)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Numeric vector of system lifetimes}

\item{C}{Logical matrix of candidate sets (n x m)}

\item{delta}{Censoring indicators (1=observed, 0=censored)}

\item{P}{Inclusion probability matrix (m x m): \verb{P[j,k] = P(j in C | K = k)}.
Diagonal can be < 1 (relaxed C1).}
}
\value{
Function that takes theta and returns m x m FIM
}
