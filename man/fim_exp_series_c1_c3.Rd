\title{Fisher Information Matrix for exponential series system (C1, C3) - Relaxed C2}
\usage{
fim_exp_series_c1_c3(t, C, delta = NULL, P)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Numeric vector of system lifetimes}

\item{C}{Logical matrix of candidate sets (n x m)}

\item{delta}{Censoring indicators (1=observed, 0=censored)}

\item{P}{Inclusion probability matrix (m x m): \verb{P[j,k] = P(j in C | K = k)}.
Diagonal must be 1 (C1). If NULL, treated as unknown parameters.}
}
\value{
Function that takes theta and returns m x m FIM
}
\description{
Returns the observed Fisher information matrix (negative Hessian) for
masked data with informative masking. The P matrix must be known.
