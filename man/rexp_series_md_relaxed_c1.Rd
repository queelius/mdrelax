\title{Generate masked data with relaxed C1}
\usage{
rexp_series_md_relaxed_c1(n, theta, P, tau, keep_latent = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Sample size}

\item{theta}{Rate parameters for exponential components}

\item{P}{Inclusion probability matrix (m x m). Diagonal can be < 1.}

\item{tau}{Right-censoring time}

\item{keep_latent}{If TRUE, include latent variables in output}
}
\value{
List with t, delta, C, k
}
\description{
Generates data where the failed component may not be in the candidate set.
\code{P[k,k] < 1} means the failed component k is only included with that probability.
}
