\title{mdrelax: Relaxed Candidate Set Models for Masked Data in Series Systems}
\description{
Likelihood-based inference for exponential and Weibull series systems with masked failure data under relaxed candidate set conditions. Implements models for standard (C1-C2-C3), informative masking (relaxed C2), parameter-dependent masking (relaxed C3), and relaxed C1 conditions. Includes data generation, maximum likelihood estimation, Fisher information, and simulation study framework. Minimal dependencies for use in Monte Carlo simulation studies.
