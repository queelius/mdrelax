Description: Likelihood-based inference for exponential and Weibull series systems
    with masked failure data under relaxed candidate set conditions. Implements
    models for standard (C1-C2-C3), informative masking (relaxed C2),
    parameter-dependent masking (relaxed C3), and relaxed C1 conditions.
    Includes data generation, maximum likelihood estimation, Fisher information,
    and simulation study framework. Minimal dependencies for use in Monte Carlo
    simulation studies.
